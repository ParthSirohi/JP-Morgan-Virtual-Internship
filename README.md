# JP-Morgan-Virtual-Internship
I did a virtual internship at JP Morgan Chase & Co in which in interfaced with stock price data feed and set up the system for  
analysis of the data followed by implementation of the Persepective open source code in preparation for data visualization.
Finally I used Persepective(JP Morgan's Framework) to create the chart for the trader's dashboard
